# Resizable and Draggable Widget in Kivy

A draggable and resizable widget implemented in Kivy with 8 control points. You can move it and resize it any way you want, just click and drag on the edges or corners.

- When you hover your mouse over the control points, you can see the cursor changing.
- When you click on the edge, you can see its color changing. If you click on a corner, two edges will be selected.
- You may want to change the `MINIMUM_HEIGHT`, `MINIMUM_WIDTH` constants to get the behaviour you want.

I was using this widget in one of my projects, I hope it helps someone that needs something similar.
